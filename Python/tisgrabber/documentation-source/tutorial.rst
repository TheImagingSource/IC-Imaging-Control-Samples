This tutorial shows how to get started with Python and the C-Wrapper DLL "tisgrabber".
It needs Python 3 and Python ctypes being installed.

The samples referenced in this tutorial can be found in the "samples" directory.

Annotation: The use of the tisgrabber functions is similar in Python and C. 
Thus C programmers can use this tutorial too.
